## Project thoughts

While I am hesitant in the specifications of exactly what I would like to look into, I am reasonably sure that I would like it to be somewhat along the lines of the following.

Much of what my classes focus on this semester is based around the inequalities that stem from the hierarchy structured into American society, favoring the wealthy and genetically favored. I want to look into data that paints a clearer timeline and story of exactly what variables play into an individual in the lower class/poverty overcoming their disadvantages and achieving social or economic mobility, and the type of environmental factors that others should focus on in order to reach the same goal; working their way up the hierarchy.
